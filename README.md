# Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I like to break down the overall functionality into seperate components. This helps to keep organized and isolate different parts of the software to better understand how each piece works together. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
When designing programs, I start by adding simple functionality to get a working program. Then, throughout the desin process, I add functionality to reach the desired goals of the program. Throughout this project, each milestone gave me a better grasp of the overall code which allowed me to add and improve different functions.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The knowledge I gained from this course aids my future educational and professional pathway because I've learned new skills and technologies that allows me to broaden my capabilities. In terms of eduction, I learned more about C++ which will help in future courses. For my future, professional pathway, I now have a basic knowledge of computational graphics and visualizations which opens more oportunities to different types of jobs. This course has increased my interest in this field and I might possibly pursue a carreer in game design.
